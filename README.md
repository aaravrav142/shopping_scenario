### Shopping Scenario Meta Package

This package holds shopping scenario related code, models, and documentation.

To run it (after the robot performing the shopping tasks was started and localized), just do

```bash
$ roslaunch shopping_scenario_executive shopping_scenario.launch
```

and it should start all necessary components.
